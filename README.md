# Agent4SE: Systematic Literature Review on Intelligent Agents for Software Engineering

## üìñ Overview

With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), **Intelligent Agents** have emerged as powerful enablers of software engineering (SE) tasks. Yet, definitions, architectures, and evaluation practices remain fragmented.

To address this, we conducted a **Systematic Literature Review (SLR)** of **215 peer-reviewed studies** published between April 2023 and July 2025.  

Our study contributes:  
- A **classification framework** mapping agent typologies and task-specific deployments across the software development lifecycle (SDLC).  
- A synthesis of **technological pillars**: orchestration, retrieval-augmented grounding, transparent planning, and tool integration.  
- A **consolidated evidence base** on benefits and limitations.  
- A **research agenda** for robust and accountable adoption of agents in SE.

## üîç Research Questions

We address three core questions:  

1. **Concept & Scope** ‚Äì How are Intelligent Agents conceptualized in SE, and where are they applied?  
2. **Technologies & Patterns** ‚Äì What architectures, coordination strategies, and tool integrations underpin them?  
3. **Challenges & Directions** ‚Äì What barriers limit effectiveness, scalability, and trustworthiness, and what agenda can address them?
